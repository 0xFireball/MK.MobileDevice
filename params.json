Absolutely free and open source! Program your iOS device to do your bidding! Create awesome automation programs that detect your iPhone wirelessly!\r\n\r\n\r\n# MK.MobileDevice\r\nMK.MobileDevice - A powerful, versatile library providing multiple interfaces to access and manipulate iOS devices over USB and WiFi (using both Apple drivers and custom drivers for Linux recompiled for Windows) written in C#. (Still being actively developed)\r\n\r\n- Yes, it's open-source, licensed under the `GPLv3`; please see `LICENSE` for more information.\r\n- It's GPL because there are too many closed source programs (iMazing, iExplorer, Syncios, etc.) that have similar functionality. I wanted an open community library and some open source tools.\r\n\r\n## Announcements\r\n- **iOS 10 ready!** - As soon as the new iPhones are released, support will be added for them too! Right now, all devices from the very first iPad/iPhone to the iPad Pros and 6s are supported!\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nUse a **Simple, concise API** to do all kinds of cool things with your iDevice, over a USB cable or **wirelessly** (with iTunes WiFi Sync). You can use it as a sort of remote-control iTunes or something. Make your device do your bidding with **MK.MobileDevice**!\r\n\r\nHere is a short list containing SOME (there are a LOT more features) of the many features of this library\r\n- **Full AFC access in the `/private/var/mobile/Media` directory** - transfer files back and forth!\r\n- Full developer disk image support and mounting (EVEN ON WINDOWS/Linux!!!!)\r\n- Take screenshots remotely! (you must mount developer disk first)\r\n- Connect to device - USB and even **Wirelessly**!!!\r\n- **Remotely reboot, shut down, enter/exit recovery mode!**\r\n- Manage iCloud activation lock!\r\n- Activate a [hidden Semi-Sleep/Lock state](https://0xfireball.github.io/MK.MobileDevice/html/9b17a6a7-9c58-c770-230c-5981aeca32f6.htm) (not yet tested on iOS 10, but it may work!)\r\n- Manage Applications (Install, Uninstall, Archive, Restore, Remove Archives, etc...)\r\n- Manage home screen layout (extract layouts, send layouts)!\r\n- Rename device name!\r\n- Full GasGauge battery diagnostics!\r\n- Extract metadata such as phone number, UDID, IMEI, etc.\r\n- Query apple property services for information like iCloud activation, etc.\r\n- And lots more! If there's anything important I didn't mention here, let me know!\r\n\r\n- Some of the APIs require certain components protected by Apple's EULA, so please install iTunes, or at least Apple Mobile Device Support and Apple Application Support. I do not believe I am allowed to redistribute them.\r\n\r\n# Planned features!\r\n- SSH Access (with Jailbreak)\r\n- Device port forwarding!\r\n\r\n# [Get Started](#install)\r\n\r\nDriver DLLs for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows are included, and you can build your very own set of native DLLs from the [libimobiledevice-win64](https://github.com/exaphaser/libimobiledevice-win64) project.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n**Yes, I am willing to provide support, **but only as time permits**. Please post your question/issue in [Issues](https://github.com/exaphaser/MK.MobileDevice/issues)**\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n# Getting set up [See Install](#install)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Documentation\r\nDocumentation is available on [the github page](http://0xFireball.github.io/MK.MobileDevice/docs)\r\n\r\n#Install\r\n- An **outdated** version of MK.MobileDevice is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MK.MobileDevice/) :( Please don't use this.\r\n- I recommend either **cloning the repository** ([how](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)) or **downloading the artifacts from [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/0xFireball/mk-mobiledevice).**\r\n\r\n## Once you have obtained a copy, proceed to the [Wiki](https://github.com/exaphaser/MK.MobileDevice/wiki) for more information.\r\n",
